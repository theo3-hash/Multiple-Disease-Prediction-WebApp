🏥 Multiple Disease Prediction System

A Machine Learning-based web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of three major diseases:

🩺 Diabetes

❤️ Heart Disease

🎗️ Breast Cancer

The application provides an interactive user interface where users can enter medical parameters and receive instant prediction results powered by trained ML models.

🚀 Features

✅ Multi-page navigation using streamlit_option_menu

✅ Real-time disease prediction

✅ Clean and structured user interface

✅ Pre-trained Machine Learning models

✅ Separate modules for:

   Diabetes Prediction

   Heart Disease Prediction

Breast Cancer Prediction

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Streamlit

Scikit-learn

Pickle

Streamlit Option Menu

📊 How It Works

Select a disease prediction module from the sidebar.

Enter the required medical parameters.

Click the prediction button.

The system displays whether the person is likely to have the disease.

The predictions are generated using trained Machine Learning classification models saved using pickle.

🎯 Project Objective

This project demonstrates:

Practical implementation of Machine Learning models

Deployment of ML models using Streamlit

Development of healthcare prediction systems
